    - name: UNION operator in BigQuery
      url: /mdn/union-operator-in-big-query
  note: >
    In BigQuery the `UNION` operator will throw an exception like `Expected keyword ALL or keyword DISTINCT`.

    To emulate `UNION` in BigQuery and combine two result sets without duplicates we need to use the `UNION` operator with the `DISTINCT` keyword.
