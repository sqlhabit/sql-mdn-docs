    In PostgreSQL the `coalesce()` function is expected to receive arguments of only one type (and `NULL`-s).

    This query will be executed successfully: `coalesce(NULL, 123, 456)` (all arguments are numerical).

    This query will fail: `coalesce(NULL, 123, 'abc')` (since we're mixing numerical and text arguments).
